## Project Overview
Following the Code Institute Milestone 1 requirements, this is a three-page static website built with semantic HTML5 and CSS3. It serves as an educational hub for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security and Operational Technology (OT) protection.

### **Site Structure (3-Page Architecture)**
1. **Home:** Executive overview of ICS risks and the project mission.
2. **Architecture:** Detailed breakdown of the Purdue Model and network segmentation.
3. **Threats:** Analysis of common attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

## User Experience (UX)
The site was developed according to UX principles and user story requirements:
* **As a Plant Manager:** I want to see a high-level visual of network layers to understand where security investments are required.
* **As a Security Engineer:** I want a mobile-responsive resource to verify security best practices while on the factory floor.

## Design and Architecture
The project follows a structured design process to ensure technical and visual clarity.

### **The Purdue Model**
The site is architected around the Purdue Model for Industrial Control Systems. This model ensures that information is segmented logically, reflecting real-world industrial network hierarchies.

### **Wireframes**
I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma for both Mobile and Desktop views. This allowed for the planning of responsive behavior and semantic structure prior to the development phase.
