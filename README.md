# ICS Security Hub - Code Institute Milestone Project 1

This project is a professional web prototype designed to bridge the gap between technical ICS security standards (NIST 800-82) and non-technical plant management.

## User Experience (UX)
### Target Audience
- **Plant Managers:** Need a high-level understanding of risks without getting lost in code.
- **OT Staff:** Need a quick reference for the Purdue Model architecture.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a clear visual of the Purdue Model so I can understand network segmentation.
- As a user, I want to compare different cyber threats and their physical impacts on the plant.
- As a user, I want a site that works on my smartphone while I am on the factory floor.

## Design
### Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes were created using Figma to plan the "Card-based" layout for both Desktop and Mobile views. (Link to your initial_wireframes_desktop_mobile.png here later).

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation:** A 3-page structure with a mobile-ready stacked menu.
- **Active Page Indicators:** Clearly shows the user which section they are currently viewing.
- **Purdue Model Integration:** Detailed architectural breakdown for industrial security.
- **Case Study Analysis:** Technical deep-dive into the Stuxnet attack.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling and Media Queries for responsiveness.
- **Figma:** UI/UX Design and Wireframing.
- **VS Code:** Primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Deployment
The site is currently developed locally. Future deployment will be via GitHub Pages.
