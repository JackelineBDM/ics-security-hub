## User Experience (UX)
The site was developed according to UX principles and user story requirements:
* **As a Plant Manager:** I want to see a high-level visual of network layers to understand where security investments are required.
* **As a Security Engineer:** I want a mobile-responsive resource to verify security best practices while on the factory floor.

## Design and Architecture
The project follows a structured design process to ensure technical and visual clarity.

### **The Purdue Model**
The site is architected around the Purdue Model for Industrial Control Systems. This model ensures that information is segmented logically, reflecting real-world industrial network hierarchies.
